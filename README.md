#### 1.Coffee Consumer Count

- Select the top 5 cities based on coffee consumers to decide where to open new coffee stores.
```sql
SELECT 
    city_name,
    ROUND((population / 1000000), 2) AS population_in_millions,
    ROUND((population * 0.25) / 1000000, 2) AS coffee_population_in_millions,
    city_rank
FROM city
ORDER BY population DESC;
```

#### 2.Total Revenue from Coffee Sales

- What is the total revenue generated from coffee sales across all cities in the last quarter of 2023?
```sql
SELECT 
    c.city_name,
    SUM(total) AS total_revenue
FROM sales s 
JOIN customers cus ON s.customer_id = cus.customer_id
JOIN city c ON cus.city_id = c.city_id 
WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2023 
  AND QUARTER(sale_date) = 4
GROUP BY c.city_name
ORDER BY SUM(total) DESC;
```

#### 3.Sales Count for Each Product

- How many units of each coffee product have been sold?

#### 4.Average Sales Amount per City/Customer

#### Method 1: Customer-level average.

GROUP BY cus.customer_name, c.city_name
ORDER BY AVG(s.total) DESC;
```

#### Method 2: City-level average.
```sql

#### 6.Top Selling Products by City

)
SELECT 
    city_name,
    product_name,
    total_volume
FROM cte
WHERE rnk <= 3
ORDER BY city_name;
```

#### 7.Customer Segmentation by City

- How many unique customers are there in each city who purchased coffee products?

```sql
SELECT 
    ci.city_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM sales s
JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN city ci ON c.city_id = ci.city_id
WHERE s.product_id IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14)
GROUP BY ci.city_name;
```

#### 8.Average Sale vs Rent

        ) AS prev_month_sales
    FROM cte
)
SELECT 
    city_name,
    month_,
    year_,
    ROUND(
        (cr_month_sales - prev_month_sales) / NULLIF(prev_month_sales, 0) * 100.0,
        2
    ) AS growth_percent
FROM cte2
WHERE prev_month_sales IS NOT NULL;
```

#### 10.Market Potential Analysis

        SUM(s.total) AS total_sales,
        COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS total_customers
    FROM sales s
    JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
    JOIN city ci ON c.city_id = ci.city_id
    GROUP BY ci.city_name

cte2 AS (
    SELECT 
        city_name,
        estimated_rent,
        (population * 0.25) AS coffee_populated_percent
    FROM city
)
SELECT 
    cte.city_name,
    cte.total_sales,
    cte.total_customers,
    cte2.coffee_populated_percent,
    ROUND((cte.total_sales / cte.total_customers), 2) AS avg_total_sales,
    cte2.estimated_rent,
    ROUND((cte2.estimated_rent / cte.total_customers), 2) AS avg_rent
FROM cte
JOIN cte2 
    ON cte.city_name = cte2.city_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
